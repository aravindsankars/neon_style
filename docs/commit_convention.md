## Commit Message Guidelines and Conventions

Commit message headings vary depending on the specific conventions and guidelines followed by a development team or organization. However, here are some commonly used commit message headings that are considered industry standard or best practices:

1.  **feat**: Used when introducing a new feature or functionality.
2.  **fix**: Used when fixing a bug or resolving an issue.
3.  **docs**: Used when making changes to documentation.
4.  **style**: Used for changes related to code formatting, whitespace, or style.
5.  **refactor**: Used when making code changes that do not affect the external behavior but improve code structure or readability.
6.  **test**: Used for adding or modifying tests.
7.  **chore**: Used for general maintenance tasks, build processes, or other non-functional changes.
8.  **perf**: Used when making performance-related improvements or optimizations.
9.  **ci**: Used for changes related to the continuous integration (CI) pipeline or configuration.
10.  **build**: Used for changes to the build system or build scripts.
11.  **revert**: Used when reverting a previous commit.
12.  **merge**: Used to indicate a merge commit.

It's important to note that these headings are not strict rules, but rather common conventions. The most important aspect is to choose a clear and descriptive heading that accurately reflects the purpose of the commit. Additionally, it's a good practice to provide a concise and meaningful commit message body to provide further details about the changes made.
