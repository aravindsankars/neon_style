### Creating a Pull Request
Once you have made changes to your forked repository, you can create a pull request to merge your changes into the dev branch of the original repository. Before creating a pull request, ensure that your fork is up-to-date with the original repository's development branch. This can be done by syncing your fork with the original repository using the "git fetch" and "git merge" commands.

### Code Review
All pull requests will be reviewed by our team. We appreciate constructive feedback, and we may ask for changes or further information before merging your pull request.
